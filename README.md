### What is this?
This is the last project I worked on during my Summer break of 2021. It was my first ever experience with OpenCV, TensorFlow and other computer vision tools so I had to do a lot of research. The conceptual idea was simple: create a program that looks at your face and determines the emotion then plays music to match the mood. Bringing this to reality was not. The program was coded in Python and uses many libraries and frameworks such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and TKinter. The tools I had to use forced some innaccuracies in the program that I didn't expect. Nevertheless, I still believe the program fullfills its purpose and is thus successful.
